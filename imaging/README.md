# Imaging data analysis

This directory contains Columbus scripts (`*.aas`) to process data from the RNAi imaging screen, for the following phenotypes:

- mitotic delay and multinucleation
- chromosome segregation errors
- cell shape
- cytokinetic defects
- centrosome spindles

Raw data will be available at the Image Data Resource (IDR, Dundee, UK) upon publication of the manuscript.
